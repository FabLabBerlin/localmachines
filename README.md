##Quick start
This solution is supposed to be run on a computer like the Raspberry Pi to benefit from it's GPIO pins - it's where the external hardware has to be connected in order to get full support of FabSmith's features.

You will need to install BeeGo MVC framework to make use of the code found in this repository. Refer to the official [BeeGo installation instuctions](http://beego.me/quickstart) to do that.

##Versioning
FabSmith will benefit form semantic versioning. Read about it [here](http://semver.org).
