##Quick start
This solution is supposed to be run on a computer like the Raspberry Pi to benefit from it's GPIO pins - it's where the external hardware has to be connected in order to get full support of FabSmith's features.

##Versioning
FabSmith will benefit form semantic versioning. Read about it [here](http://semver.org).
