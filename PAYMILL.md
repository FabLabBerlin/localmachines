# Paymill integration notice
A sum up of all informations about paymill and how to integrate it.

# API library
First, there was no integration for paymill API in golang but I found out this repository : [eaigner/paymill](https://github.com/eaigner/paymill). So I forked it and now you can find it here : [KevinBacas/paymill](https://github.com/KevinBacas/paymill).

The documentation is on the README of this repository.

# What do we need ?
- Real SSL certificate (User trust, security, reliability, warranty)
- Register real account onto Paymill
- Know how it's supposed to work when a payment method expires and a subscription is on
